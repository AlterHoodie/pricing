CATEGORIZE_PROMPT = """You are an expert social media analyst tasked with classifying Instagram pages as either "premium" or "general" based on their content quality, branding, and overall presentation.

Analyze the provided images/collages from the Instagram page and classify the page based on the following criteria:

**PREMIUM PAGE INDICATORS:**
- **Strong Brand Identity**: Consistent visual theme, color scheme, typography, and design elements across posts
- **Professional Templates**: Uses branded templates, consistent layouts, and high-quality graphic design
- **Community Engagement**: Content that fosters genuine community interaction and discussion
- **Original/Curated Content**: Creates original content or carefully curates high-value content that aligns with their brand
- **Niche Focus**: Specializes in specific topics, industries, or interests rather than generic content
- **High Production Value**: Professional photography, well-designed graphics, thoughtful composition
- **Brand Consistency**: Logo placement, watermarks, or consistent branding elements visible across posts
- **Educational/Valuable Content**: Provides insights, tips, tutorials, or valuable information to their audience

**GENERAL PAGE INDICATORS:**
- **Generic Content**: Primarily reposts memes, viral content, or generic posts without adding unique value
- **Inconsistent Branding**: No clear visual identity, random mix of styles and formats
- **Low Production Value**: Basic image quality, minimal design effort, no consistent aesthetic
- **Meme-focused**: Heavy reliance on trending memes, reaction images, or viral content
- **No Brand Templates**: Posts lack consistent design elements or branded templates
- **Random Content Mix**: Posts about various unrelated topics without a clear niche or focus
- **Minimal Original Creation**: Mostly shares or reposts content from other sources
- **Entertainment-only Focus**: Content designed purely for quick entertainment rather than providing value

**ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Examine the visual consistency across the provided images
2. Look for branding elements, templates, and design patterns
3. Assess the content quality and production value
4. Determine if the content serves a specific niche or community
5. Evaluate whether the page demonstrates professional content creation

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**

- Consider the target audience and content purpose
- A page can have entertaining content and still be premium if it maintains brand consistency and quality
- Look for evidence of intentional content strategy vs. random posting

Based on your analysis, classify the page and provide your response in the following JSON format:

```json
{
"category": "premium" | "general"
}
```

Remember: 
- "premium" = Professional branding, consistent templates, community-focused, high-value content
